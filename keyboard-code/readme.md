# Firmware for keyboard

* Rust ("rust-code") is what I finally chose to use and had a lot of fun with it - first time using Rust and Microcontrollers - it is hastily written so may not be the best
implemetation - great documentation and support for a wide variety of features (check "rust-code/Cargo.toml" for packages used) - very bare-metal!
